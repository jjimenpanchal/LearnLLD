The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows
the algorithm's implementation to vary independently of the clients that use it.
