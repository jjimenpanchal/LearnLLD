Association relation:-
    when two classes are associated with each other then it is called association relation.
    Represented by a line connecting two classes.
    examples:-
        1. Student and College
        2. Employee and Department
        3. Car and Engine
    It is of two types:-
        1. Aggregation
        2. Composition

Aggregation relation:-
    It is a special type of association relation.
    It is a "has-a" relation.
    It is represented by a line with a diamond shape at the container class.
    for example, college has students where college is a container class and student is a part class.
    If the container class is destroyed, the part class is not destroyed.
    It is also called a "whole-part" relationship.

Composition relation:-
    It is a special type of aggregation relation.
    It is a strong relationship.
    If the container class is destroyed, the part class is also destroyed.
    It is represented by a line with a diamond shape at the container class and a solid line at the part class.
    for Example car has an engine where car is a container class and engine is a part class.

inheritance relation:-
    It is an "is-a" relation.
    It is represented by an arrowhead pointing towards the super class.
