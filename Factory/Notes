Factory design pattern:-
    it's a creational design pattern.
    when we want different objects to be created based on some condition, we can use factory design pattern.
    Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to
    return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client
    program to the factory class.
